Although VoIP.ms SMS is open source and licensed under the Apache License 2.0,
it is generally not open to unsolicited pull requests. This is because I prefer
to work on it by myself, and prefer not to review or maintain code I did not
write.

Pull requests may be still be accepted on a case-by-case basis, but please ask
before writing any code.
